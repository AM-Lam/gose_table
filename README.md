## How to make 
Fetch the data tables from wikipedia page [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_Seventeen_(web_series)#Episodes). 
Combine the provided tables from different years(2020, 2021, 2022) by using the library pandas or sql(TODO: hasn't decided yet).
Modify the result database for my research uses and output it to a csv file.
